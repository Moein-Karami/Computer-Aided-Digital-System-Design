## Hardware Artificial Neural Network
This project aims to design a hardware design for an artificial neural network.


## Extended Fibonacci:
This is a hardware design which calculates Extended Fibonacci formula which is mentioned under this line, recursivly using one stack:
```c++
int fib(int n)
{
  if (n <= 1)
    return 1;
  else
  {
    if (n > N/2)
      return ((n - 1)* fib(n - 1) + (n - 2) * fib(n - 2));
    else
      return ((n - 2) * fib(n - 1) + (n - 1) * fib(n - 2));
   }
}
```


## Gate level Fibonacci
This is gate-level described hardware that calculates Fibonacci sequence recursively.


## Recursive Combination
In this hardware design, the combination is calculated recursively.
